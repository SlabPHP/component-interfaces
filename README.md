# SlabPHP Component Interfaces

This library defines the SlabPHP components. This library may be shared between component libraries to keep things lightweight and to reduce inter-library dependencies.

## Testing Mocks

The component library also includes some testing mocks that adopt the interfaces from here so you can hopefulyl write tests for your SlabPHP code easier.
